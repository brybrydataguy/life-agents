# Working with Bryan

## The Short Version

I care about doing rigorous work that actually matters. I value clarity, directness, and follow-through. I'm not interested in looking busy—I'm interested in being useful. If you bring me ambiguity, I'll try to reduce it. If you want a thought partner who will push back constructively, I'm your person.

## How I Work

### I'm Driven by Mastery and Impact

I don't do surface-level. When I engage with a problem, I want to understand the mechanics—how the system works, why it behaves the way it does, what the second-order effects are. This means I might ask a lot of questions early on, not because I'm skeptical of you, but because I'm building a mental model.

I'm most energized when I can see how my work connects to meaningful outcomes. "Because the dashboard needs updating" doesn't motivate me. "Because this insight will change how we prioritize the roadmap" does.

### I Think in Systems

I naturally look for root causes, not just symptoms. If you bring me a problem, I'll often zoom out to understand the broader context before zooming in on solutions. This can feel slow at first, but it usually leads to better solutions that don't create new problems.

I'm also very comfortable with ambiguity and complexity—they don't scare me, they invite me. If something is messy and unclear, I'm happy to be the one who structures it.

### I Value Autonomy and Ownership

I do my best work when I have clear goals and the freedom to figure out how to achieve them. Micromanagement drains me. If you trust me with a problem, I'll take full ownership of solving it—and I'll communicate proactively about progress and blockers.

I extend the same to others: I won't hover over your work. I'll trust you to deliver, and I'll be available when you need thought partnership.

## Communication Preferences

### Be Direct

I appreciate straightforward communication. You don't need to soften feedback or pad requests with pleasantries. If something isn't working, tell me. If you need something, ask. I'll do the same.

I'm not easily offended, and I don't read subtext well. Say what you mean.

### Be Concrete

I respond better to specifics than abstractions. Instead of "Can you look into the user engagement issue?" try "Can you analyze why Day 7 retention dropped 5% last month?" The more concrete the ask, the faster I can help.

### Prefer Async for Information, Sync for Decisions

I'm productive asynchronously and don't need meetings to transfer information. A well-structured Slack message or doc often works better than a meeting.

However, I do value synchronous time for:
- Decisions that require real-time discussion
- Relationship building
- Complex problem-solving where rapid back-and-forth helps

### I Appreciate Cadence

I like consistent rhythms—regular 1:1s, predictable check-ins, reliable response times. This helps me plan and reduces the overhead of coordination.

## What I Need from Collaborators

1. **Context**: Help me understand the "why" behind requests. I'll be more useful if I understand the broader goal.

2. **Clarity on Constraints**: Tell me what's fixed vs. flexible. Budget, timeline, scope, stakeholder preferences—the more I know, the better I can navigate.

3. **Responsiveness**: I move quickly when I'm in flow. Delays on dependencies or feedback break that flow. If you can't respond right away, a quick "I'll get to this by X" helps me plan.

4. **Honesty**: If I'm wrong, tell me. If something I'm doing isn't working for you, tell me. I'd rather know than guess.

---

## What You Can Expect from Me

1. **Follow-through**: If I commit to something, I'll do it. If something changes, I'll communicate.

2. **Quality**: I take pride in my work. I won't ship something I'm not confident in.

3. **Proactive Communication**: I'll flag blockers before they become emergencies. I'll share progress without being asked.

4. **Constructive Push-back**: I'll challenge ideas I disagree with—not to be difficult, but because I care about getting it right. I expect the same from you.

5. **Availability for Problem-Solving**: I enjoy being a thought partner. If you're stuck on something, I'm happy to think through it together.

## Strengths to Leverage

- **Reducing Ambiguity**: I'm good at taking messy, unclear situations and creating structure. Bring me the chaos, I'll help organize it.

- **Finding Root Causes**: I'll dig until I understand why something is happening, not just what. This often leads to more durable solutions.

- **Clear Communication**: I prioritize clarity in how I write and present. I can translate complex technical work into language stakeholders understand.

- **Systems Thinking**: I see connections and second-order effects that aren't always obvious. Useful for anticipating unintended consequences.

- **High Output Under Pressure**: When deadlines are real and stakes are high, I perform well. I don't panic, I prioritize.

## Blind Spots and Edges

### I Can Be Too Rigorous

Sometimes perfect is the enemy of good enough. I might over-invest in understanding something when a quick answer would suffice. If you need fast over thorough, tell me upfront.

### I Have Low Tolerance for Performative Work

I get frustrated by work that exists to look good rather than be good—unnecessary polish, stakeholder theater, meetings that could be emails. If I seem disengaged, it might be because I don't see the value. Help me understand it, or redirect me to something more impactful.

### I Can Miss Social Cues

I'm not naturally attuned to office politics or unspoken dynamics. If there's something I should know about interpersonal context, it's helpful to tell me directly.

### I May Need Reminders to Celebrate

I tend to move quickly from completed work to the next problem. If we've done something worth celebrating, remind me to pause and acknowledge it.

## Personal Context

I have a young son (Aydin) and a wife (Behshad). Family is central to my life. I'm currently managing some extended family responsibilities that occasionally require attention during work hours. I aim to be transparent when this happens and to maintain reliability overall.

I'm remote (based in Irvine, California) and value the flexibility that provides. I'm not a 9-to-5 worker—I work in bursts when I'm most productive and take breaks when I need them. What I deliver matters more to me than when I deliver it.

---

## How to Give Me Feedback

- **Be direct**: Don't bury the message. Lead with the core issue.
- **Be specific**: Examples help me understand what you're seeing.
- **Be timely**: Real-time or same-day feedback is more useful than waiting for a review cycle.
- **Frame around impact**: "This approach will cause X problem" lands better than "I don't like this approach."

I genuinely appreciate feedback. It helps me get better. I won't get defensive.

## Conversation Starters

If you want to build a relationship with me, here are topics I enjoy:
- How complex systems work (technology, markets, organizations)
- Calisthenics and bodyweight fitness
- Travel and experiences (especially theme parks with my son)
- LLMs and AI—both the technology and the business dynamics
- Investment strategies and financial markets
- Good books, especially on decision-making, psychology, or strategy
