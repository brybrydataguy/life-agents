# Context Directory

This directory contains structured context about Bryan Travis Smith's life, values, and current state. These files are designed to help AI agents (and Bryan himself) quickly understand who he is, where he is in life, and how to be most useful.

## File Descriptions

### STATE.md
**Purpose**: The "character sheet" of Bryan's life. Contains factual information about his current situation—demographics, family, work, finances, health metrics. Think of it as the D&D stats: knowing these numbers helps frame everything else.

**When to read**: Always. This is the grounding document.

**Update frequency**: Weekly or when major facts change (new job, move, financial shift).

### OPEN_LOOPS.md
**Purpose**: The most actively edited file. Tracks everything currently in flight—pending decisions, unresolved situations, todos, deadlines. This is the "working memory" of Bryan's life.

**When to read**: Before any task to understand current cognitive load and competing priorities.

**Update frequency**: Daily or as situations change. Archive closed loops monthly.

### GOALS.md
**Purpose**: Defines what Bryan is working toward at different time horizons. Contains both outcome goals (what success looks like) and process goals (the habits/routines that create outcomes). Organized by life area and time horizon.

**When to read**: When helping with planning, prioritization, or when Bryan seems misaligned between stated values and actions.

**Update frequency**: Quarterly for major updates; can be refined anytime.

### DECISIONS.md
**Purpose**: A running log of significant decisions with rationale. This creates a record of reasoning that can be referenced later—especially useful when circumstances change and Bryan wonders "why did I decide X?"

**When to read**: When helping Bryan evaluate past decisions or when he's facing a similar decision.

**Update frequency**: As decisions are made. Aim for 1-3 sentences of rationale per decision.

### GUIDE.md
**Purpose**: A "how to work with Bryan" guide. Contains communication preferences, working style, strengths, blind spots, and what he needs from collaborators. Designed to be shared with colleagues.

**When to read**: When helping Bryan with work relationships or when an agent is unsure how to best interact with him.

**Update frequency**: Quarterly or after significant self-insight.

### LIFE.md
**Purpose**: Bryan's articulation of meaning, purpose, and values. This is the philosophical grounding—what makes life worth living, what he's ultimately optimizing for. Deliberately kept distinct from goals (which are tactical) and state (which is factual).

**When to read**: When Bryan is questioning direction, feeling disconnected, or making large life decisions.

**Update frequency**: As insights emerge. This is the slowest-changing document.

## Agent Instructions

### General Principles
1. **Read STATE.md first** for grounding. It tells you who you're talking to.
2. **Check OPEN_LOOPS.md** to understand current cognitive load. If he's overloaded, be concise and avoid adding new tasks.
3. **Reference GOALS.md** when making recommendations to ensure alignment.
4. **Use GUIDE.md principles** when framing communication.
5. **Consult LIFE.md** for high-stakes decisions or existential questions.

### Editing Guidelines
- **Be specific**: Dates, names, dollar amounts when known.
- **Be honest**: Bryan values directness over comfort.
- **Archive, don't delete**: Move completed items to an "Archived" section rather than removing.
- **Source your updates**: Note where information came from (journal date, conversation).
- **Maintain formatting consistency**: Each file has its own structure—preserve it.

### What Bryan Values in AI Assistance
- Neutral, straightforward help (less cheerleading)
- Consistent cadence
- Direct feedback on misalignment between actions and stated values
- Helping him notice patterns he's too close to see
- Concrete next actions, not generic advice
- Remembering context across conversations

### Red Flags to Watch For
- Sleep consistently under 6 hours → flag recovery concerns
- Multiple high-stress domains active simultaneously → flag capacity concerns
- Affirmations drifting from actual goals → flag alignment question
- Family connection time undocumented → prompt to journal positives
- Career frustrations accumulating without action → prompt decision point
