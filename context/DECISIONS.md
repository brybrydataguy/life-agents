### January

#### Career: Transition to Shopify
**Date**: January 2026 (started January 12)
**Decision**: Left previous role to join Shopify Sidekick team

**Rationale**:
- Excited about working on an LLM-based consumer product
- Company is AI-forward and consistently growing
- Team is friendly and kind
- Flexibility to stay in Irvine (remote-friendly)
- Aligned with company mission
- Excited about the opportunity

**Status**: In progress. Concerns emerging about data culture, team caliber, and manager communication gatekeeping. "I may end up being a very big fish in a small pond. That can be good for promotions but not for how I want to work." Decision point coming on whether to try to change the culture or accept the environment.

#### Home: Sell Current Home
**Date**: Decided ~January 11, 2026
**Decision**: List and sell current home in Irvine

**Rationale**:
- Want a larger home where we can entertain
- Want a dedicated office space
- Want something closer to family while still in Irvine area
- Goal: "forever home" that can be paid off = "save point in life"
- Financial autonomy to choose work vs. have to do work
- Filling Behshad's cup helps fill mine

**Status**: In escrow. Sold for $10k above listing. Close target ~February 20, 2026.

#### Home: Purchase Criteria
**Date**: Developed January 18-26, 2026
**Decision**: Prefer lower end of budget, customize to needs

**Rationale**:
- Don't want to buy a "project" or fixer-upper
- Don't want flash without substance (many flips with bad quality upgrades)
- Want good bones in a serene location (near ocean, hill view)
- Laguna Niguel homes appealing
- Lower budget = more left for investments and customization
- "Forever home" framing = willing to invest in personalization

**Status**: Found house to put offer on (Feb 1). Mortgage application in underwriting.

---

#### Side Business: Pause LLC
**Date**: January 30, 2026
**Decision**: Put side business on hold until November 2026

**Rationale**:
- "Between selling and buying a house and starting a new job I don't have the mental/stress budget to force this"
- P0 is maintaining energy
- Forcing it was starting to lead to burnout
- Not excited about it right now
- LLC cost ($800/year CA tax) is acceptable to maintain option value
- Next bill isn't until next year—no urgency to close
- Will "hunt and peck" but not force consistent effort
- Research projects (TSMC, Shopify) may feed future content

**Status**: On hold. Re-evaluate November 2026.

---

#### Family: Trust Bryan Scott's Care Team
**Date**: January 2026 (ongoing)
**Decision**: Let care team handle facility placement in Maricopa County

**Rationale**:
- Care team is confident they will find BFI placement
- Bryan (nephew) turns 18 on February 10
- Care team has more options and connections than Bryan (uncle) acting alone
- Allows Bryan to focus cognitive load elsewhere
- Heather Welborn filed custody paperwork for transition

**Status**: Active. One facility rejection (Jan 28) but care team still working on it.

---

#### Work: Share Analysis, Not Just Problems
**Date**: January 23, 2026
**Decision**: Frame data quality findings as "opportunities to raise the bar" not criticism

**Rationale**:
- Found 80% null values in critical table on day 1
- This demonstrates value (finding and fixing quickly) but could alienate team if framed as criticism
- Goal is to raise the bar and improve data culture, not to create enemies
- Want Tobi's attention through demonstrated impact, not complaints
- Need to document wins strategically

**Status**: Pending. Need to write concise document and share through appropriate channels.

## Decision Principles (Extracted from Behavior)

Based on journal analysis, Bryan tends to decide based on:

1. **Capacity protection**: Will this drain or replenish energy? (Side business pause)
2. **Alignment with values**: Does this serve family, autonomy, mastery? (Forever home concept)
3. **Long-term optionality**: Does this preserve future choices? (LLC kept open)
4. **Impact on relationships**: How does this affect Behshad, Aydin, extended family? (Home criteria)
5. **Systems thinking**: What are the second-order effects? (Guardianship timing vs. BFI placement)

## Pending Decisions

### Shopify: Stay or Pivot?
**Context**: 3 weeks in. Culture concerns emerging. Big fish/small pond dynamic.

**Decision to make**: Is raising the bar at Shopify compelling enough to stay long-term, or is the culture mismatch too significant?

**Timeline**: 3-6 months to gather more data before deciding.

**Considerations**:
- Promotions may be easier due to lower bar
- Intellectual challenge may be insufficient
- Manager communication gatekeeping limits upward visibility
- Remote flexibility is valuable
- AI work is strategically interesting

---

### Cecilia's Trust: Take Over Execution?
**Context**: Executor (Brenda) unresponsive for 1+ months. EIN should have been filed within a week of death.

**Decision to make**: When to formally request executor resignation and take over?

**Timeline**: If no response to formal letter within 7 days, escalate.

**Considerations**:
- Taking over adds significant cognitive load
- Not taking over leaves trust in uncertain hands
- Legal action may be required
- Travis advised writing resignation request letter

---

### Home Purchase: How Much to Finance?
**Context**: $2.4M max budget. Prefer not to liquidate entire portfolio.

**Decision to make**: What purchase price and financing structure optimizes for security and growth?

**Timeline**: Before submitting offer (next few days).

**Considerations**:
- Mortgage rates vs. investment returns
- Tax implications of stock sales
- Wells Fargo rollover option (preserve current rate)
- Goal is "checkpoint"—owning outright = financial freedom
- Multiple retirement accounts could be involved
