## Bryan's Notes (Original)

"I am currently trying to determine my life's purpose. This is a work in progress. I do not have an answer that resonates."

Some thoughts:
- I want to be a source of goodness
- I want to reduce suffering in the world
- I want to increase happiness
- I want to feel meaning and connection every day
- I want to define my life in a way that maintains joy, autonomy, power and fulfillment
- I want to feel pulled into life vs pushing into life

## A Bold Take (From Claude, February 2026)

Bryan, you asked me to be bold. Here's what I see.

### The Core Pattern

You are a **builder of stability who craves aliveness**.

This tension runs through everything: you construct systems, accumulate resources, and create "checkpoints" that provide security—but security alone leaves you feeling neutral, not fulfilled. You need the stability *so that* you can take risks, engage deeply, and feel the full range of life. The "forever home" isn't the goal; it's the launchpad.

Your parents are gone. Your dog is gone. You've had a year of loss. And yet you're still waking up at 5am to do handstand progressions, still meditating, still showing up for your son, still taking on guardianship of a nephew with severe challenges. You're not running from life. You're running *toward* it—but with an intensity that sometimes exhausts you before you get there.

### What Actually Gives You Meaning

Based on your journals, not your stated goals:

**1. Being Present for the People Who Need You**

You keep showing up. For Bryan Scott, who has every disadvantage stacked against him and no one else. For Aydin, even when you snap and then repair. For Behshad, even when you're both stressed. For Alex and Steph, even from a distance.

You wrote on January 1: "I also need to be there for Bryan and Angela—they do not have anyone." This isn't obligation talking. This is who you are. You see people who need someone to anchor them, and you become that anchor.

**2. Mastery That Matters**

You don't want to just be good at things. You want your expertise to *do something*. The frustration at Shopify isn't about the work being easy—it's about the work not mattering enough. When you find broken data that no one noticed for months, you fix it. When you see systems that should be better, you want to improve them.

You're not satisfied by competence for its own sake. You need your mastery to land—to change decisions, improve products, help people. When it doesn't, you feel like you're "coasting," and coasting feels like dying slowly.

**3. Shared Joy, Not Solo Achievement**

Your happiest moments aren't achievements—they're experiences with people you love. Dave & Busters with Aydin. Nerf gun battles in front of the garage. The spins on the walk to school. The Christmas vacation that left you "wanting more time with my family and friends."

You wrote: "Happiness, joy, and meaning are grounded in relationships with emotional and physical contact." You know this. The question is whether you're protecting enough space for it.

**4. Becoming, Not Having**

"I seemed to gain the most not from the goals but by the habits and processes I established. To become a pianist instead of learning to play piano."

This is profound and true to how you operate. You're not after destinations. You're after the kind of person who naturally arrives at good places. The handstand isn't the goal—being someone with that capability is. The wealth isn't the goal—being someone who creates value and shares it is.

### A Proposed Purpose Statement

Here's my attempt. Refine it until it resonates.

---

****

---

This captures both sides:
- The **stewardship** (creating conditions for others)
- The **aliveness** (fully inhabiting, not just maintaining)

It's not about achievement. It's not about wealth. It's about making a container that's safe enough to be fully alive in, and then actually being alive in it.

### The Trap to Avoid

ChatGPT nailed it: "Perpetual optimization → life becomes a backlog."

You're wired to improve things. Systems, bodies, portfolios, data pipelines—you see how they could be better and you want to make them better. This is a gift when applied to the right things. It's a curse when applied to everything.

The risk: You create the checkpoint (the forever home, the financial security, the physical capability) but never cash it in. You keep optimizing instead of *living*. The nervous system never gets the signal: "We're safe. We did enough."

You've already noticed this. On January 30, you paused the side business because "forcing this is starting to lead to burnout. I'm not excited to do it." That's a checkpoint *you actually took*. Do more of that.

### What "Pulled Into Life" Might Look Like

You said you want to feel pulled into life vs pushing into life.

**Pushing** looks like: forcing yourself to work on the side business because you "should," staying up late to optimize when you're already exhausted, maintaining habits even when recovery signals say stop, affirming "enormous wealth" when what you actually want is security and autonomy.

**Pulled** looks like: playing Nerf guns with Aydin because you want to, exploring TSMC financials because you're genuinely curious, feeling excited to solve a hard problem at work, wanting to call Travis because you miss him, waking up eager for the day.

The question isn't "What should I do?" The question is "What am I pulled toward?" And then: "Am I creating conditions that let me follow that pull?"

### Regarding Grief

Your mom died six months ago. Your dad died five years ago. You are now the senior generation—there's no one between you and mortality.

You haven't written much about this directly, but it's there. Crying when you got the house offers and wanted to tell your parents. Processing loss while navigating logistics. The torn meniscus from yoga "after my mom died"—the body breaking when the heart is breaking.

Grief isn't a problem to solve. It's an experience to integrate. It will surface when it surfaces. The goal isn't to process it efficiently—it's to let it be part of the texture of your life without letting it consume you.

You're doing this. The morning routine, the therapy, the affirmations that catch misalignment—these are grief-integration practices even when they don't look like it. You're building a life that can hold sorrow and joy simultaneously.

### A Final Thought

You wrote on January 1: "I only have one consciousness. I only have one will. I only have a limited time on this earth."

This is the deepest truth. Everything else—the goals, the systems, the optimizations—serves this or doesn't.

You're not here to maximize output. You're here to live fully while you can.

The people you love, the work that matters, the body that can do impressive things, the mind that sees patterns others miss—these are the instruments. The question is what music you'll play.

The last one might be the hardest—and the most important.

## Questions for Ongoing Reflection

- When did I last feel truly *pulled* toward something?
- What would I do if I believed I was already enough?
- Who am I becoming through my daily practices?
- What matters most about this particular day?
- Am I inhabiting the life I've built, or still building?
