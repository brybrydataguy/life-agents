# Purpose

I am currently trying to determine my life's purpose.  This is a work in progress.   I do not have an answer that resonates.

## Some thoughts

- I want to be a source of goodness
- I want to reduce suffering in the world
- I want to increase happiness
- I want to feel meaning and connection every day
- I want to define my life in a way that maintains joy, autonomy, power and fulfillment
- I want to feel pulled into life vs pushing into life
