## Key Stats Summary (D&D Style)

| Attribute | Current | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Energy** | Low | Sleep 5-6hr, fatigue accumulating |
| **Cognitive Load** | High | New job + house sale + trust + nephew |
| **Financial Security** | Strong | $1.6M portfolio + $800K home equity |
| **Family Connection** | Moderate | Daily presence, but stressed quality |
| **Career Satisfaction** | Uncertain | 3 weeks in, culture concerns emerging |

## Current Life Phase

**Assessment**: "High-Load Transition"

Simultaneously managing:
1. New high-leverage role at Shopify (3 weeks in)
2. Complex real estate transition (selling + buying)
3. Nephew's 18th birthday and guardianship (9 days away)
4. Mother's trust execution issues
5. Personal grief processing
6. Daily discipline maintenance

**Implication**: Cognitive load is at capacity. Optimization energy is fully deployed. Maintenance mode for side projects and stretch goals is appropriate. This is a sprint, not sustainable.
