## URGENT (Next 10 Days)

### Bryan Scott Smith - Turning 18 on February 10, 2026
**Status**: Critical - 9 days remaining
**Owner**: Bryan (with DCS/care team)

- [ ] Facility placement still not secured (rejected from latest facility Jan 28)

- [ ] Guardianship hearing date needs to be calendared
- [ ] Heather Welborn filed custody paperwork for when he turns 18
- [ ] If placed in BFI home, may need to delay guardianship until after placement (to not remove him from DCS/Foster system)

**Context**: Bryan has TBI and PTSD, impulsive, prone to violence under stress. Recently had a violent incident (hit another kid, police involvement threatened). Has a TikTok girlfriend in Nebraska he wanted to move to instead of Havasu.

**Waiting On**:
- Care team to find BFI home in Phoenix area
- Confirmation from Heather on guardianship timeline

### Aydin's Birthday
**Status**: Coming up on Feburary 9th
**Owner**: Bryan

- [ ] Ask Aydin what he wants for his birthday present

**Context**: "I've been so distracted with the house stuff and Bryan's stuff that I forgot to ask Aydin what he wants for his birthday."

## HIGH PRIORITY (February 2026)

### Home Sale - In Escrow
**Status**: Active - Close target ~February 20, 2026
**Owner**: Bryan & Behshad

- [x] Listed January 22, 2026
- [x] 50+ open house visitors
- [x] Multiple offers received and countered
- [x] Accepted offer $10k above listing (~January 30)
- [x] Escrow started
- [ ] Inspections this week
- [ ] Buyers coming Monday for measurements
- [ ] Clean house before Monday visit
- [ ] Close escrow ~February 20
- [ ] 30 days post-close to move out (may not use full time)

### Home Purchase
**Status**: Active search
**Owner**: Bryan & Behshad

- [ ] Found a house to put offer on (as of Feb 1) [20941 Parkridge](https://www.redfin.com/CA/Lake-Forest/20941-Parkridge-92630/home/4818170)
- [ ] Applied for mortgage, documents uploaded
- [ ] Underwriting in process
- [ ] Target: Submit offer Monday/Tuesday
- [ ] Budget: Prefer lower end of $2.4M max to customize as "forever home"

**Decision Point**: Want something with good bones in a serene location (near ocean, hill view), not a flip or project. Laguna Niguel homes appealing.

- [ ] Model home purchase scenarios (what if keep more stocks invested? mortgage rates? true cost of different price points?)
- [ ] Wells Fargo mortgage rollover inquiry (preserve rate, avoid stock sale/taxes) - mentioned multiple times, not done

### Cecilia's Living Trust - Executor Issues
**Status**: Escalating - preparing for legal action
**Owner**: Bryan (monitoring executor Brenda at Bidwell)

- [ ] Brenda (executor) unresponsive for 1+ months
- [x] Called Brenda January 27 - claims waiting on EIN via SS-4 form
- [x] Sent email re-requesting EIN mail date and tax filing acknowledgment
- [ ] Brenda has not responded to mail date request
- [x] Talked to Travis - advised writing letter asking executor to resign
- [x] Behshad researched: EINs should be filed within a week of death
- [ ] Send formal letter requesting resignation and securing correspondence/bills
- [ ] Set 7-day response deadline
- [ ] Build document trail for potential legal action

**Context**: Trust execution is taking far longer than normal. Either not a priority or something is off. Bryan feeling anxiety about having to step in and take over.

**Open Question**: Consider updating trust allocation (higher for Bryan Scott due to disability, concerns about Alex's drug use, ensuring Alex doesn't stay in home after 18).

## MEDIUM PRIORITY (February-March 2026)

### Special Needs Trust for Bryan Scott
**Status**: Accounting incomplete
**Owner**: Bryan

- [ ] Basic accounting done but need to confirm:
  - [ ] Room/board arrangements
  - [ ] How to structure his purchases and income
  - [ ] Where to store excess funds

- [ ] Connect with his school (Bryan will be POC when he's 18)

### Shopify Career
**Status**: Ramping (3 weeks in)
**Owner**: Bryan

- [x] Found and fixed critical data quality issue
- [x] Drafted both analyses, got positive peer feedback
- [x] Sent to manager for review
- [x] Getting included in DS/PM meetings
- [ ] Share token issue findings strategically
- [ ] Schedule 30-min coffee with a Shopify colleague (non-manager, non-frustrated DE) - overdue
- [ ] Document Shopify data quality findings in concise write-up ("opportunities to raise the bar")
- [ ] Decide: Is "raising the bar" at Shopify genuinely compelling, or is the culture mismatch too significant?

**Concerns to Monitor**:
- Manager wants to control all leadership communication
- DE collaboration friction (premature conclusions)
- Peer leaving for Intuit due to pay
- Pressure to move fast vs be rigorous

## LOWER PRIORITY (Stretch/Deferred)

### Side Business (LLC)
**Status**: Explicitly paused
**Owner**: Bryan

- [ ] Decision made: On hold due to capacity constraints

- [ ] Re-evaluate in November 2026
- [ ] Original idea: Document learning into lessons/seminars/content to sell
- [ ] Currently doing research projects (TSMC, Shopify) that could feed this later

**Status**: Deferred
**Owner**: Bryan

- [ ] Roll over retirement accounts into single account
- [ ] Update Shopify website (personal)
- [ ] Write a blog post

### Research Projects
**Status**: Active but slow
**Owner**: Bryan

- [x] Started TSMC deep-dive research
- [x] Started Shopify financials/business research
- [ ] Build dashboards to track both companies
- [ ] Document learnings as potential content
- [ ] This is "understand slow" work that conflicts with Shopify "move fast" culture
