## Philosophy on Goals

Bryan has identified that he gains more from **processes and habits** than from outcome goals. The pattern from 2025: "I seemed to gain the most not from the goals but by the habits and processes I established. To become a pianist instead of learning to play piano."

Therefore, goals are structured as:
- **Outcome**: What success looks like (the destination)
- **Process**: The habits/routines that create the outcome (the path)

## 2026 Core Goals

### Health & Energy
**Outcome**: To be well rested, full of energy, and lean. To be excited by life.

**Process**:
- Wake up every morning, exercise for ~1 hour
- Meditate for 15 minutes (10 min meditation + 5 min loving-kindness)
- Coffee after meditation/exercise; stop by noon (metabolism has slowed, caffeine takes longer to clear)
- 5g-15g of creatine daily
- Daily affirmations practice
- Sleep 7+ hours nightly

**Current Status** (Feb 2026):
- Exercise: Maintaining daily calisthenics despite high stress
- Meditation: 10m + 5m loving-kindness consistently
- Creatine: 5g daily, consistent
- Sleep: Struggling (5-6 hours, target 7+)
- Affirmations: Daily, but under review for alignment
- Keto experiment: Mixed results, not in ketosis

**Metrics to Track**:
- Sleep hours (from Apple Watch)
- Mood surveys (Tired/Wired/Comfortable, Happy/Neutral/Sad)
- Weight/body composition
- Energy levels

### Fitness
**Outcome**: Improved calisthenics performance—more and better pull-ups, pistol squats, press to handstand, handstand pushups.

**Process**:
- Progressive skill improvement with daily practice and progressions
- Skill stacking approach (build component skills that compound)
- PT exercises for knee (glute activation, rolling) to support meniscus recovery

**Current Milestones**:
- [x] Handstand hold: 30 seconds
- [x] Supported press to handstand
- [x] 5 pistol squats left leg (before injury—skill currently lost)
- [ ] 5 handstand pushups (2025 goal, not achieved)
- [ ] Full press to handstand

**Current Status** (Feb 2026):
- Recovering from torn meniscus (yoga injury post-mom's death)
- Daily workouts maintained but fatigue accumulating
- May need deload week—shoulders, back, legs not recovering well
- Night cramps appearing

---

### Connection
**Outcome**: Experience more meaning and connection every day.

**Process**:
- Daily loving-kindness meditation
- Touch Behshad and Aydin more often
- Plan vacations with friends
- Establish friendship routines with Shopify colleagues
- Set focus time with family to avoid feeling pulled away when working

**Current Status** (Feb 2026):
- Loving-kindness: 5 min daily, consistent
- Physical touch: Intentional but not tracked
- Friend vacations: Not planned yet
- Colleague routines: Not started (3 weeks at Shopify)
- Weekly calls with Travis and Sean maintained
- No in-person friend time all of January 2026

**Insight**: "Happiness, joy, and meaning are grounded in relationships with emotional and physical contact. This time and space needs to be protected and fostered."

---

### Career (Shopify)
**Outcome**: Be a recognized, significant contributor to Shopify.

**Process**:
- Develop and maintain relationships across the company
- Maintain an accurate model about the value and prioritization of work
- Deliver the most clear and high-impact work/insights
- Improve the organization
- Structure every day to maximize positive, high-energy affect
- Goal: Get Tobi's attention through demonstrated impact

**Current Status** (Feb 2026):
- Week 3 of onboarding
- Completed first analyses with positive peer feedback
- Found major data quality issue in day 1—demonstrates value but raises culture concerns
- Getting included in DS/PM meetings
- Manager gatekeeping leadership communication
- Culture appears to value speed over rigor
- Decision point emerging: Is this the right environment?

**Open Question**: "What would it look like to succeed at Shopify even if the team caliber is lower than you hoped? Is 'raising the bar' genuinely compelling, or do you need peer-level intellectual challenge to feel fulfilled?"

## 2026 Stretch Goals

### Side Business
**Outcome**: Provide a product/service others are willing to pay for.

**Process**:
- Document and package learning into lessons/seminars/content to sell

**Current Status** (Feb 2026):
- **Explicitly paused** as of January 30, 2026
- LLC active ($800/year CA tax, next bill not until 2027)
- Re-evaluate in November 2026
- Research projects (TSMC, Shopify) may feed future content

**Decision Rationale**: "Between selling and buying a house and starting a new job I don't have the mental/stress budget to force this. My P0 is to maintain energy and forcing this is starting to lead to burnout. I'm not excited to do it."

---

## Life-Level Goals

### Financial
**Outcome**: "Checkpoint" life—own forever home outright, all free cashflow goes to savings, financial autonomy to choose work vs. have to work.

**Process**:
- Complete home sale and purchase strategically
- Minimize stock liquidation during home purchase
- Consider mortgage rollover options
- Model scenarios before committing

**Current Status**: Home sale in escrow, actively searching for "forever home" in lower budget range to customize.

---

### Family Stewardship
**Outcome**: Provide stable support for extended family members who need it.

**Process**:
- Manage Bryan Scott's guardianship and Special Needs Trust responsibly
- Ensure Alex doesn't inherit in ways that enable harmful behavior
- Resolve Cecilia's trust execution

**Current Status**: High cognitive load. Bryan Scott turns 18 in 9 days. Trust executor delays escalating. Need to set boundaries on involvement to protect capacity.

---

### Personal Growth
**Outcome**: Integrate grief, maintain joy, live with meaning.

**Process**:
- Continue therapy
- Daily affirmations aligned with actual values
- Notice when behavior diverges from stated values and repair (e.g., Aydin blueberry incident)

**Insight**: "The affirmations help me call out the inconsistencies with my goals and my behaviors more easily."

## Affirmations (Under Review)

Current affirmations:
1. I am a kind, loving, and attentive father and husband
2. I can solve any problem
3. I produce impactful, clear insights
4. I generate enormous wealth and am generous with it

**Review Prompt** (from weekly summary): "You're affirming 'enormous wealth' but pausing the business. You're affirming 'clear and impactful insights' but frustrated by cultural friction. Are the affirmations aligned with what you actually want, or are they aspirational in a way that creates tension?"

**What Actually Seems to Matter** (from journal analysis):
- Autonomy and choice in work
- Quality time with Behshad and Aydin
- Being present and kind (vs. reactive/snapping)
- Intellectual challenge and mastery
- Connection with friends
- Physical capability
- Financial security (not necessarily "enormous wealth")

---

## Goal Review Schedule

- **Daily**: Track stats (sleep, workout, meditation, mood)
- **Weekly**: Journal review to assess alignment
- **Monthly**: Update GOALS.md with progress
- **Quarterly**: Major goal revision
