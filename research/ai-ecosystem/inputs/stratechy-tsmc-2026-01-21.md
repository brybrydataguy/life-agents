Good morning,

Jon at Asianometry has a new video about how the American industrial giant Westinghouse Electric Lost Its Way.

On to the Update:

TSMC Earnings
From the Wall Street Journal:

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. plans to spend a record of up to $56 billion this year to feed the world’s insatiable appetite for chips, as it grapples with pressure to build more factories outside Taiwan, especially in the U.S. Massive investments in artificial intelligence have stoked fears of an AI bubble, but TSMC’s planned capital expenditure of $52 billion to $56 billion — up 27% to 37% from last year — suggests that it doesn’t expect any pullback in orders from clients such as Nvidia, Google and Apple.

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chip maker, is in a good position to spend big, entering 2026 with another blockbuster quarter of earnings results under its belt. The need for the high-end silicon produced by TSMC powered net profit 35% higher to a record in the fourth quarter of 2025, topping consensus views, while revenue increased 20.5%.

This was a very interesting earnings call that validated a previous take I had, clarified the current challenges facing the AI infrastructure buildout, and raised the stakes in terms of there being an AI bubble or not.

The TSMC Brake
Start with my take: last quarter I wrote about the “TSMC Brake”:

I’m not sure that coming in at the top end of the predicted range qualifies as a “higher level of CapEx spending”; an analyst pushed CEO C.C. Wei on this point, noting that TSMC’s revenue has grown 50% since 2022, but CapEx has only grown 10%. There weren’t too many answers from TSMC about this, which is understandable, given that they won’t announce next year’s CapEx numbers until next quarter…

I then discussed OpenAI’s aggressive plans for an infrastructure buildout and noted:

If Altman and OpenAI are the ones pushing to accelerate the AI infrastructure buildout, it’s Wei and TSMC that are the brakes. The extent to which all of Altman’s deals actually materialize is dependent on how much TSMC invests in capacity now, and while they haven’t shown their hand yet, the company is saying all of the right things about AI being a huge trend without having yet committed to a commensurate level of investment, at least relative to OpenAI’s goals.

What that may mean is that actually achieving a true AI bubble might be dependent on Intel actually becoming a credible alternative to TSMC. Right now the Taiwanese giant doesn’t seem too concerned about losing share on the leading edge; that means they can afford to be prudent, and understandably so, given that they have the potential to be holding the biggest bag if a bubble pops. If they ever were concerned about competition, however, then that is when the spending might really ramp up.

Anyhow, we’ll have a better picture next quarter when TSMC announces their CapEx plans for 2026; that will be the most important announcement for OpenAI’s ambitions, and it’s completely out of their control.

Wei admitted that TSMC was very behind in terms of meeting demand:

Our, headache right now, if I can call it headache, is the demand and supply gap we need to work hard to narrow the gap.

Wei further explained that power wasn’t the limiter to the AI buildout; silicon is:

Talking about to build a lot of AI data center all over the world, I use one of my customers’ customers’ answer. I asked the same question. They told me that they planned this one, 5-6 years ago already. So, as I said, those cloud service providers are smart, very smart. If I knew that, I would anyway—So, they say that they work on the power supply 5-6 years ago. So, today, their message to me is: silicon from TSMC is a bottleneck, and asked me not to pay attention to all others, because they have to solve the silicon bottleneck first. But indeed, we do get the power supply, all over the world, especially in the US. Not only that, but we also look at, who support those kind of a power supply, like a turbine, like, what, nuclear power plant, the plan or those kinds of things. We also look at the supply of the rack. We also look at the supply of the cooling system. Everything, so far, so good. So we have to work hard to narrow the gap between the demand and supply from TSMC.

To that end, TSMC is significantly increasing their capital expenditures this year, from $41 billion last year to $52–$56 billion this year. However, that capital expenditure will take a while to come online:

If you build a new fab, it takes two and three year, two to three years to build a new fab. So even we start to spend $52 billion to $56 billion, the contribution to this year is almost none, and 2027, a little bit. So we actually, we are looking for 2028-2029 supply, and we hope it’s a time that the gap will be narrow…So 2026-2027 for the short-term, we are looking to improve our productivity. 2028 to 2029, yes, we start to increase our capacity significantly. And it will continue this way if the AI demand megatrend as we expected.

This gets at the real challenge facing TSMC: it’s very clear that the company spent too little on capex the last few years (the total in 2024 was only $30 billion), which is why there is such a gap between supply and demand today. The problem is that the lead time to fix that mistake is measured in years, which further raises the question as to whether that $52–$56 billion number is the right one: if there is an AI bubble, and it pops, then TSMC is left holding the bag; there is just as good of a chance, however, that by the time 2028 rolls around we are once again disappointed that TSMC didn’t invest more.

Why AI Needs Foundry Competition
This reiterates why it is very much in the interest of everyone involved in the AI buildout to bring Intel and Samsung online as suppliers. Wei was asked about Intel directly, and whether TSMC was concerned:

Well, kind of a simple question. I should say no. Let me explain a little bit, because, in these days, it’s not money to help you to compete. Right? I also like, whoever you just mentioned to invest on Intel. I’d like them to invest on TSMC also, but the most fundamental thing is, let me share with you. Today’s, technology is so complicated. So once you want to design a very, complete or advanced technology, it takes two or three years to fully utilize that technology. That’s today’s situation. And so after two to three years of preparation, you can design your product. Once you get your product being approved, it takes another one to two years to ramp it up. So, we have a competitor, no doubt about it. That’s formidable competitor. But first, it takes time. Two, we don’t underestimate their progress. But are we afraid of it? For 30-some years, we’re always in a competition with our competitor. So, no, we have confidence that to keep our business grow as we estimated.

That’s mostly correct, although the time frame may be closer to three years than the five Wei says it is. Three years from now, however, is 2029, right when we’re going to know if this year’s TSMC capex plans were sufficiently aggressive. If Nvidia, Broadcom, Google, et al want to hedge against potential TSMC conservatism — to fully remove that brake — then the time to invest in bringing an alternative supplier online is now. Yes, that will cost time and money, but the goal should be to shift risk to the foundries; right now the risk in the value chain is actually being borne by the hyperscalers who are facing the prospect of foregone revenue because they couldn’t get enough chips. The only way to make that shift is not to beg TSMC to build more, but to facilitate competition.

One more comment from Wei that really captures the current dynamic with TSMC as monopoly provider of AI chips:

You essentially try to ask whether the AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it. Yeah, you bet, because we have to invest about USD52 billion to USD56 billion for the CapEx, right? If we did not do it carefully, that will be a big disaster to TSMC for sure. So, of course, I spent a lot of time in the last three-four months talking to my customers and then customers’ customers. I want to make sure that my customers’ demands are real.

So, I talked to those, cloud service providers, all of them. Their answer is that – I’m quite satisfied with the answer. Actually, they showed me the evidence that the AI really help their business. So they grow their business successfully and healthy, and in their financial return. So, I also double check their financial status – they are very rich. That’s sounds much better than TSMC. So, no doubt, I also asked specifically that what’s the application, right? I mean, that’s, from one of the hyperscalers, they told me that helped their social media, software and so the customer continue to increase. So I believe that, and with our own experience in the AI application, we also help to, our own fab to improve the productivity as I mentioned at one time, say that 1% or 2% of productivity improvement, that is free to TSMC and that’s why also our gross margin is a little bit satisfied, even in this very high-cost period of time.

And so, all in all, I believe in my point of view, the AI is real, not only real, it’s starting to grow into our daily life. And we believe, that is kind of, we call it AI megatrend. We certainly believe that. So, your another question is, can the semiconducting industry to be good for three four five years in a row? I will tell you the truth – I do not know. But I look at the AI, it looks like, it is going to be, like, endless. I mean, that’s for many years to come. No matter what, TSMC sticks on the fundamental technology leadership, manufacturing excellence, and we work with customers to get their trust. And I think that fundamental thing is what position TSMC to be very good future growth, let me say that.

The implication of cloud service providers showing huge financial gains from AI now, combined with the admission that there is insufficient supply of silicon, is that foregone revenue isn’t a theoretical risk: it’s being foregone right now! And yet, at the same time, notice that Wei led his answer admitting to his fear: TSMC doesn’t want to be stuck holding the bag spending billions of dollars for demand that might disappear. This is a legitimate concern for TSMC, but it’s a big problem for TSMC’s customers; the only way they’re going to overcome that fear is by helping bring competition to bear, such that TSMC worries more about losing business than they do about investing too much.
