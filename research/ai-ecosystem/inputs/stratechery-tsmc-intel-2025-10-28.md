TSMC Earnings
From Bloomberg:
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. hiked its projection for 2025 revenue growth for the second time this year, reinforcing hopes in the longevity of a global boom in AI spending. TSMC, the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., now foresees mid-30% growth in annual sales, up about a few percentage points from previously. The outlook increase was striking given Taiwan’s biggest company last raised its guidance just three months ago, igniting a rally that’s tacked on more than $260 billion to its market value.

The results underscore how TSMC remains one of the bigger beneficiaries of a spending spree on AI infrastructure that’s expected to cross the $1 trillion mark in coming years. From OpenAI to Oracle Corp., industry leaders are racing to build the data centers that underpin the technology in the post-ChatGPT era. TSMC’s higher projection followed a better-than-anticipated 39% jump in net income to NT$452.3 billion ($14.8 billion) in the September quarter.

AI is being very good to TSMC. The most obvious example are those growing revenue predictions, which makes sense: no one can get enough leading edge chips, which means that TSMC’s leading fabs are running at full capacity; what is notable is that this utilization is increasing margin even as the company’s overseas fabs come online, offsetting their dilutive effect. CFO Wendell Huang said in his prepared remarks on the TSMC earnings call:

Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by talking about our third quarter ’25 and fourth quarter ’25 profitability. Compared to second quarter, our third quarter gross margin increased by 90 basis points sequentially to 59.5%, primarily due to cost improvement efforts and a higher overall capacity utilization rate, partially offset by margin dilution from our overseas fabs and an unfavorable foreign exchange rate. Compared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago by 200 basis points, mainly as the actual third quarter exchange rate was $1 to TWD29.91 compared to our guidance of $1 to TWD29. In addition, we also delivered better-than-expected cost improvement efforts.

We have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to increase by 50 basis points to 60% at the midpoint, primarily driven by a more favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by continued dilution from our overseas fabs. While the cost of overseas fabs remain higher, thanks to the company’s overall larger scale, we now expect the gross margin dilution from the ramp-up of our overseas fabs to be closer to 2% in the second half of 2025. For the full year 2025, we now expect it to be between 1% to 2% as compared to 2% to 3% previously.

TSMC’s foray abroad started during the first Trump administration, and at that point the idea of building fabs in the U.S. seemed like an inevitable margin suppressor that the company (and country) had to do to stay in the U.S.’s good graces. And, to be sure, TSMC would probably, if it had its druthers, still prefer to make everything in Taiwan: the higher costs of fabbing chips abroad is real, which is to say that TSMC’s margins could potentially be even higher.

Humans, however, are not entirely rational creatures, which is to say I think that TSMC investors would be bothered a lot more by decreasing margins than they are by margins that are up, albeit not as up as they could be. In other words, AI chip demand has increased utilization so much that margins — which are dependent on the amount of leverage you can get on your fixed costs — are going up even in the face of the foreign fab headwind, in effect giving TSMC permission to continue and even accelerate its foreign buildout.

The TSMC Brake
What is notable — and a point of some contention on the earnings call — is that TSMC’s response to this massive utilization is something of a steady-state in terms of CapEx. Huang said:

Now let me make some comments on our 2025 CapEx. As the structural AI-related demand continues to be very strong, we continue to invest to support our customers’ growth. We are narrowing the range of our 2025 CapEx to be between USD40 billion and USD42 billion as compared to USD38 billion to USD42 billion previously. About 70% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies, and about 10% to 20% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making and others.

At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with higher growth opportunities in the following years. Even as we invest for the future growth with this higher level of CapEx spending in 2025, we remain committed to delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. We also remain committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend per share on both an annual and quarterly basis.

I’m not sure that coming in at the top end of the predicted range qualifies as a “higher level of CapEx spending”; an analyst pushed CEO C.C. Wei on this point, noting that TSMC’s revenue has grown 50% since 2022, but CapEx has only grown 10%. There weren’t too many answers from TSMC about this, which is understandable, given that they won’t announce next year’s CapEx numbers until next quarter. What Wei did say is that TSMC was making a point to not just talk to its customers but its customers’ customers:

I believe we are just in the early stage of the AI application. So very hard to make right forecast at this moment. What do we do differently? There’s a big difference because right now, we pay a lot of attention to our customers’ customers. We talk to and then discuss with them and look at their applications, be it in the search engine or in social media’s application. We talk with them and see how they view the AI application to those functions. And then we make a judgment about what AI going to grow. And so this is quite the difference. As compared with before, we only talk to our customers and have an internal study.

The most important of these customers’ customers is, of course, OpenAI, and CEO Sam Altman has made his case in person; from DigiTimes in early October:

OpenAI is intensifying efforts to expand its artificial intelligence computing infrastructure, relying heavily on Taiwan’s semiconductor supply chain. On September 30, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman conducted a discreet visit to Taiwan, holding separate meetings with TSMC and Foxconn. The discussions focused on collaboration in AI chip manufacturing and AI server infrastructure development.

In OpenAI’s Windows Play I explained how OpenAI was working to make itself the center of the AI value chain, including by cultivating multiple suppliers on the chip side, but that that strategy depended on more than having an alternative to Nvidia:

There is one other part of the stack to keep an eye on: TSMC. Both Nvidia and AMD make their chips with the Taiwanese giant, and while TSMC is famously reticent to take price, they are positioned to do so in the long run. Altman surely knows this as well, which means that I wouldn’t be surprised if there is an Intel announcement sooner rather than later; maybe there is fire behind that recent smoke about AMD talking with Intel?

I asked Altman about this in the Stratechery Interview I did with him later that week:

Well, with this, the problem with this is both Nvidia and AMD are sourced at the same place, so there’s another solitary entity in the value chain, which is TSMC. Do you see a need and responsibility/opportunity to expand the market there as well? Is this something where when it comes to the question of Intel—

SA: I would like TSMC to just build more capacity.

What did you think I was asking, about multi-chip suppliers?

SA: Do I see a need to get TSMC to expand their rate of investment in more capacity?

Got it.

I thought this was a curious interaction at the time, but I found these earnings clarifying. First off, I definitely think I’m right: OpenAI would benefit from there being more than one leading edge chip supplier. Secondly, however, Altman doesn’t see Intel as an alternative, which means that for now his infrastructure dreams are indeed dependent on TSMC building out more capacity, and he doesn’t want to say or suggest anything that might dissuade them from doing exactly that.

To put it another way, if Altman and OpenAI are the ones pushing to accelerate the AI infrastructure buildout, it’s Wei and TSMC that are the brakes. The extent to which all of Altman’s deals actually materialize is dependent on how much TSMC invests in capacity now, and while they haven’t shown their hand yet, the company is saying all of the right things about AI being a huge trend without having yet committed to a commensurate level of investment, at least relative to OpenAI’s goals.

What that may mean is that actually achieving a true AI bubble might be dependent on Intel actually becoming a credible alternative to TSMC. Right now the Taiwanese giant doesn’t seem too concerned about losing share on the leading edge; that means they can afford to be prudent, and understandably so, given that they have the potential to be holding the biggest bag if a bubble pops. If they ever were concerned about competition, however, then that is when the spending might really ramp up.

Anyhow, we’ll have a better picture next quarter when TSMC announces their CapEx plans for 2026; that will be the most important announcement for OpenAI’s ambitions, and it’s completely out of their control.

Intel Earnings
Speaking of Intel, from the Wall Street Journal:

Intel’s turnaround effort gathered momentum as it reported sales growth in its core product line of PC processors and shrinking costs across the company, the result of layoffs and other cuts that have accelerated this year. The beleaguered chipmaker, which has fallen badly behind rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices in the race to develop powerful AI chips, reported on Thursday net income of $4.1 billion for the third quarter compared with a year-earlier loss of $16.6 billion. On a call with analysts, Intel Chief Executive Lip-Bu Tan highlighted “the steady progress we are making to rebuild the company” and said his priority is keeping up the pace toward making its businesses more efficient.

I wondered a few weeks ago the extent to which the last Intel earnings call — particularly the suggestion that the company might not do 14A — was a negotiation tactic, and, well, it turns out that while management still made comments about needing external customers to increase capacity, it does feel good about where it is at for 14A. CFO David Zinsner said on the earnings call:

I would say that I think customers understand that it takes time from the time you deploy capital to the time where you have output. And so our expectation is we will get those commitments firmed up in time to deploy the capital, in time to meet the demand.

I’d also say we’re in a reasonably decent position given the CapEx investments we’ve already made. So we have a lot of the assets on the books and in what we call assets under construction. We’ve made a lot of investments around the shelf space. So we do see line of sight to driving a reasonable amount of supply for our external foundry customers with our existing footprint and quite honestly, with the use of the assets under construction and reuse of equipment that we have on the books today.

So I think we have flexibility. Obviously, if things go better, we may be looking to invest more into that more quickly, but we feel reasonably confident we can react to the situation.

So 14A is fine; well played Lip-Bu Tan.

What I did find notable on the call were Zinsner’s comments about how one of Intel’s biggest problems in transitioning from being an integrated manufacturer to a standalone foundry was that they used to just not care about yields at all. In response to an analyst question about margins:

I’m not sure yields in older nodes has been a big focus of ours, quite honestly. So we’re blazing new trail on this. The yields are adequate to address the supply, but they are not where we need them to be in order to drive the appropriate level of margins. And by the end of next year, we’ll probably be in that space. And certainly, the year after that, I think they’ll be in what would be kind of an industry acceptable level on the yields.

Zinsner said in response to another question about the impact of older nodes on Intel Foundry’s profitability:

I mean obviously you may be listening in on some of my conversations with the team here because that’s definitely something I’ve been making the point of. I would say there’s two dynamics, one of which you’re hitting on, and that is the high cost of older processes versus the better cost structure for the newer processes. And that’s obviously meaningful. I mean we’re in negative gross margin territory for foundry. That makes a meaningful improvement if you move it even into the positive territory.

But the other aspect of our gross margin is a function of just the product quality. We’re in reasonably decent shape on client in terms of product performance and competitiveness with a few exceptions, but we’re not where we need to be on a cost basis. And so we’ve got to make improvements there. And we have that on the road map. The team recognizes it, but that’s a multiyear process to get there.

But it’s more pronounced on the data center side. Not only do we not have the right cost structure, but we also don’t have the right competitiveness to really get the right margins from our customers. And so we’ve got work to do there. And so that’s what Lip-Bu and the team has pulled in, are hyper-focused on, is getting great products at the right cost structure to drive better gross margins. That to me, I think, is the linchpin in all this.

This really is Intel’s slow motion downfall summarized: Intel’s business became completely dependent on having the most advanced processes; that made up for a declining design business, allowing the company to still charge very high prices, which by extension let the company not care about yields. Once the company lost its process lead, however, it was stuck with non-competitive products that cost way too much to make because yields were bad. Getting out of the hole the company is in requires working backwards: getting acceptable yields, and having competitive products; that will bring the customers and revenue that — hopefully — will give the company the capital necessary to get back in the lead from a process perspective.

And, if/when they do, I do believe there is a major potential customer in OpenAI that would be thrilled to have them give TSMC some competition; customer — or even customers’ customers — input is useful to take into account. It’s competition that actually drives action.
