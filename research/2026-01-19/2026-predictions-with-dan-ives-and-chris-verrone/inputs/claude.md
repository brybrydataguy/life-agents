## DAN IVES' PREDICTIONS

### 1. Tech Stocks Will Rally 20-25% in 2026

**Prediction**: Tech stocks could surge 20-25% in 2026, with AI entering its monetization phase.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Ives describes 2026 as an "inflection point year" and the "prove it year" for AI
- Every dollar spent on Nvidia chips drives an $8-10 multiplier across tech ecosystem
- Focus on "derivative" beneficiaries of AI spending

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Tech valuations already elevated after strong 2025 performance
- Rising regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs
- Potential for AI investment bubble concerns

**Probability Assessment**: **65-75% LIKELY**
- Rationale: Strong institutional momentum and AI infrastructure spending support bullish outlook, but 25% gains require sustained growth without major corrections

---

### 2. Apple-Google Gemini Partnership & $5 Trillion Valuation

**Prediction**: Apple will announce formal partnership with Google to integrate Gemini into iPhones, driving Apple's valuation past $5 trillion in 2026. AI monetization could add $75-100 per share.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- ✅ **ALREADY HAPPENED**: Apple and Google announced multi-year partnership on January 12-13, 2026
- Apple paying Google ~$1 billion annually for Gemini integration
- New Siri powered by Gemini launching spring 2026
- Google's market cap hit $4 trillion following announcement
- iPhone 17 Pro standardizing 12GB RAM for AI capabilities

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Apple's current AI strategy has been criticized as "invisible" and "head-scratching"
- Implementation delays - upgraded Siri pushed multiple times
- Privacy concerns with cloud-based AI processing

**Probability Assessment**: **CONFIRMED - Partnership Already Announced**
- $5 trillion valuation: **50-60% LIKELY** by year-end 2026
- Depends on successful Siri rollout and consumer adoption

---

### 3. Tesla Robotaxi Expansion to 30+ Cities

**Prediction**: Tesla will successfully launch robotaxis in over 30 cities in 2026 and begin scaled production of Cybercabs.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Tesla launched limited robotaxi service in Austin, TX on June 22, 2025
- ~135 robotaxis currently in service as of December 2025
- Cybercab production scheduled to begin April 2026
- Expansion planned for Miami, Dallas, Phoenix, Las Vegas
- Musk targeting removal of safety monitors by end of 2025/early 2026

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Service currently requires human safety monitors
- Multiple documented incidents: wrong-side driving, phantom braking, traffic violations
- NHTSA investigation launched within 24 hours of Austin launch
- Regulatory approval challenges for unsupervised operation
- California threatening to ban Tesla sales over deceptive marketing claims
- Skeptics like Ross Gerber believe Tesla can't catch up to Waymo

**Probability Assessment**: **25-35% LIKELY**
- Rationale: Significant regulatory hurdles and safety concerns make "30+ cities" target very aggressive. More realistic: 5-10 cities with continued safety oversight

---

### 4. Tesla Stock Price Targets

**Prediction**: Tesla base case $600/share, bull case $800/share, with autonomous driving worth $1 trillion alone to Tesla's story.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Tesla stock hit record highs in late 2025
- Strong investor enthusiasm for autonomous vehicle potential
- Expanding product lineup: Semi, Optimus robot, Cybercab

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Vehicle delivery numbers declining
- Significant backlash from Musk's political involvement affecting sales
- Competitive pressure from Waymo and other autonomous vehicle companies
- Regulatory uncertainty

**Probability Assessment**: **40-50% LIKELY** for base case of $600
- Bull case of $800: **15-25% LIKELY**
- Heavily dependent on robotaxi approval and execution

---

### 5. Palantir: Path to $1 Trillion Valuation

**Prediction**: Palantir could reach $1 trillion market cap within 2-3 years, driven by commercial segment revenue growth.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- PLTR stock up 143.5% in 2025
- Strong positioning in AI-native enterprise platforms
- Deep government and enterprise data integration
- Commercial segment showing acceleration

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Currently trading at ~$180/share
- Widely considered one of most overvalued stocks in market
- Would require massive multiple expansion from current levels
- Competitive pressure in enterprise AI space

**Probability Assessment**: **10-20% LIKELY**
- Rationale: While Palantir has strong positioning, $1 trillion valuation within 2-3 years requires unprecedented growth and multiple expansion. More realistic: Strong performance but not reaching $1T by 2026-2027

---

### 6. Oracle Turnaround - $250/Share Target

**Prediction**: Oracle successfully builds out datacenter targets, converts massive AI backlog ($530B RPO, $300B OpenAI pipeline), and hits $250/share.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Significant AI infrastructure investments
- Strong enterprise relationships and trust
- Partnerships with major AI companies including OpenAI
- Cloud capacity expansion underway

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Recent lackluster earnings report raised concerns
- Current "dark negative sentiment" on stock
- Questions about AI spending sustainability
- Execution risk on datacenter buildout

**Probability Assessment**: **35-45% LIKELY**
- Rationale: Aggressive target requiring flawless execution. Oracle has infrastructure and relationships, but converting backlog to revenue faces execution challenges

---

### 7. Microsoft & Azure Underestimation

**Prediction**: Microsoft could be "significant outperformer" with Azure growth underestimated by Wall Street. Enterprise AI adoption through Azure will accelerate.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- MSFT up 15.6% in 2025
- Strong enterprise AI positioning
- Deep integration with OpenAI (though relationship cooling)
- Dominant cloud market position

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Heavy competition from AWS and Google Cloud
- Significant capex requirements for AI infrastructure
- Potential slowdown in enterprise AI spending

**Probability Assessment**: **60-70% LIKELY**
- Rationale: Microsoft has strongest enterprise AI position and Azure continues solid growth, though "significant outperformance" depends on execution

---

### 8. Cybersecurity Overlooked - CrowdStrike & Palo Alto

**Prediction**: Cybersecurity will be one of top-performing subsectors. CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks are top picks.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- CrowdStrike up 41% in 2025
- Security needs scale with AI complexity
- Expanding enterprise landscapes increase attack surfaces
- Strong growth potential as AI adoption accelerates

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Palo Alto Networks struggling - only up 2% YTD in 2025
- Competitive cybersecurity market
- Some enterprise spending caution

**Probability Assessment**: **70-80% LIKELY**
- Rationale: Security is non-discretionary and scales with AI adoption. Strong fundamental case for the sector

---

### 9. Nebius as Acquisition Target

**Prediction**: AI infrastructure provider Nebius will be acquired by Microsoft, Alphabet, or Amazon in 2026.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- NBIS stock up 212% in 2025
- Ives specifically named it top AI infrastructure pick
- Strong technical positioning and datacenter capacity
- $3 billion AI infrastructure agreement with Meta
- First cloud in Europe to operate Nvidia's Blackwell GPUs
- Stock spiked 14% on day Ives' comments were publicized

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Recent IPO - may prefer independence
- Hyperscalers can build own infrastructure
- Valuation may be too high post-rally
- Regulatory scrutiny on big tech acquisitions

**Probability Assessment**: **30-40% LIKELY**
- Rationale: While strategically valuable, big tech faces antitrust scrutiny and Nebius may prefer independent growth after strong 2025 performance

---

### 10. AI Power Shortage as Major Risk

**Prediction/Warning**: Energy availability remains big risk for AI trade. Two functional data centers in Santa Clara can't "plug in" due to power constraints. Could cause delays and corrections.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Documented power supply constraints in key data center markets
- Nuclear energy gaining attention as solution
- Ives "keen on nuclear energy" specifically due to power shortage
- Real infrastructure bottlenecks emerging

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Significant investment in power infrastructure underway
- Alternative energy solutions being deployed
- Grid improvements in development

**Probability Assessment**: **75-85% LIKELY** that power remains constraint
- Rationale: Real physical infrastructure limitations. Will cause delays but likely not derail AI entirely - creates opportunities in energy/power sectors

## CHRIS VERRONE'S PREDICTIONS

### 11. Sector Rotation: "Handoff" to Real Economy

**Prediction**: First half of 2026 will see handoff from speculative parts of economy to real economy stocks: transports, regional banks, housing, chemicals, commodities.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- These sectors "off the playing field for 2-3-4 years"
- Some qualify as "AI derivatives"
- Historical market rotation patterns
- Deregulation benefiting real economy sectors

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Tech continues to dominate market leadership
- Economic growth concerns could hurt cyclicals
- Interest rate uncertainty

**Probability Assessment**: **50-60% LIKELY**
- Rationale: Rotation thesis has merit given valuations and policy environment, but timing difficult to predict. Partial rotation more likely than complete handoff

---

### 12. Financials & Regional Banks Outperformance

**Prediction**: Financials, especially regional banks, will perform strongly. Bank of America closed at first high since November 2006. Deregulation regime coming benefits sector. 2026 could bring major M&A activity.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Bank of America up 27% in 2025, recently hit 52-week high at $54.65
- Strong Q4 2025 earnings: $7.6B net income (up 12% YoY), revenue up 7%
- 2026 NII growth guidance: 5-7%
- Active deregulation underway:
  - OCC and FDIC withdrew 2013 leveraged lending guidance
  - Federal Reserve changed supervisory ratings for large bank holding companies
  - Reduced enhanced supplementary leverage ratio requirements
- 7 consecutive weeks of loan growth (longest since Q2 2022)
- M&A activity accelerating: 47 deals completed YTD, 96 pending
- Recent major mergers: PNC acquired FirstBank, Fifth Third merged with Comerica

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Regional banks still face "lack of scale" penalty
- Net interest margin pressure from rate environment
- Regulatory complexity despite deregulation momentum
- Credit quality concerns in some segments

**Probability Assessment**: **70-80% LIKELY**
- Rationale: Strong earnings momentum, genuine deregulation progress, improved loan growth, and M&A activity support bullish thesis. BAC already hit new highs validating prediction

### 13. Bitcoin Weakness Signals Market Shift

**Prediction**: Bitcoin weakness (down from $125,000 October high to current levels) tells investors there's handoff happening to real economy stocks. While BTC could recover to $105-110K, weakness is "first tell" that 2026 is about owning "real stuff" not "purely liquidity-driven, high beta, speculative assets."

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Bitcoin down ~30% from October 2025 highs
- Trading around $87,000 in December 2025, down 22% in Q4
- Bitcoin up only ~6% in 2025 while gold surged 73%
- Relative underperformance vs traditional assets
- Shift in capital flows toward real economy

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Strong institutional support continues - $23B ETF inflows in 2025
- Spot Bitcoin ETFs holding ~$100-120B AUM
- 76% of global investors plan to expand digital asset exposure in 2026
- Multiple analyst targets: $120-170K (CoinShares), $150K (Standard Chartered), $170K (JPMorgan)
- Structural improvements: regulatory clarity, ETF adoption, corporate adoption

**Probability Assessment**: **MIXED** - 60-70% LIKELY for narrative, but actual Bitcoin performance uncertain
- Rationale: Verrone's read on market psychology and rotation appears correct - Bitcoin IS showing weakness relative to gold and real economy assets. However, Bitcoin could still recover to $105-110K+ range as he suggests. The "handoff" thesis is partially playing out but Bitcoin may not be finished

---

### 14. Commodities & Metals Strength

**Prediction**: Strength in commodities, especially metals in recent months, reflects turn toward real economy. Mining stocks (Rio Tinto, BHP, Freeport-McMoRan) and energy stocks could be viewed as third or fourth-derivative AI plays.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Gold surged 73% in 2025 (per multiple sources)
- Silver gained 142.6% in 2025
- Precious metals rallying to all-time highs while Bitcoin weakens
- AI infrastructure requires massive amounts of copper, rare earths, metals
- Nuclear energy renaissance for AI power needs benefits uranium sector
- Geopolitical tensions driving safe haven demand

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Cyclical commodities face economic slowdown risks
- China economic concerns could pressure industrial metals
- Oil prices volatile amid geopolitical uncertainty

**Probability Assessment**: **70-80% LIKELY** for continued strength
- Rationale: AI infrastructure creates genuine physical demand for metals. Safe haven demand for gold remains strong. Energy transition and nuclear renaissance support commodities

### 15. Housing Market "Still Dead"

**Statement**: Housing market remains challenged (discussed at 28:26 timestamp in episode).

**Supporting Evidence**:
- High mortgage rates continue to constrain affordability
- Limited inventory in many markets
- Affordability crisis ongoing
- Demographic headwinds in some regions

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- Verrone mentioned "housing" as part of sectors "having their say" in 2026
- Some regional markets showing strength
- Pent-up demand from millennials reaching peak home-buying age
- Potential for mortgage rate declines if Fed cuts rates

**Probability Assessment**: **60-70% LIKELY** market remains constrained
- Rationale: Structural affordability challenges persist despite potential for some improvement

---

### 16. Software Sector Struggles

**Statement**: Software facing challenges (discussed at 40:35 timestamp).

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Enterprise software spending scrutiny
- Shift from growth-at-all-costs to profitability focus
- Competition from AI-native solutions
- Valuation compression in SaaS sector

**Contradicting Evidence**:
- AI-enabled software could drive new growth
- Essential enterprise software remains sticky
- Digital transformation still underway

**Probability Assessment**: **70-75% LIKELY** for continued near-term pressure
- Rationale: Sector faces genuine headwinds from spending scrutiny and AI disruption, though not all software companies equally affected
