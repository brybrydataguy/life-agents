### Summary of the Episode
The episode, titled "2026 Predictions with Dan Ives and Chris Verrone | The Real Eisman Playbook Episode 40," features host Steve Eisman discussing market trends with Dan Ives (Wedbush Securities) and Chris Verrone (Strategas Research Partners). Uploaded on January 5, 2026, it recaps 2025's market volatility, including AI narrative shifts, tariff impacts, and sector performances. The bulk focuses on 2026 outlooks across tech, AI, housing, financials, software, healthcare, commodities, Fed policy, and crypto. Key themes include AI's early-stage potential, a shift from speculative to "real economy" assets, and limited Fed easing. Discussions draw on 2025 data like tech capex growth (20-30%) and sector rotations, with predictions emphasizing opportunities in AI derivatives, real economy plays, and turnarounds in lagging sectors.

Below, I summarize the main statements and predictions, grouped by theme for clarity. For each, I've included supporting or contradicting data from current (January 2026) sources, and an evaluation of its probability of being correct. Probabilities are estimated based on early-year trends, economic forecasts, and market data—high (>70% chance), medium (40-70%), or low (<40%)—considering factors like volatility, policy changes, and execution risks. Since we're only weeks into 2026, these are forward-looking assessments.

### 1. **AI and Tech Sector Outlook**
   - **Prediction: Tech stocks up 20%+ in 2026, driven by AI derivatives (e.g., Microsoft, Oracle as outperformers; no AI bubble yet, early demand cycle; AI risks like energy delays or LLM diminishing returns could cause 6-9 month pullback).** (From Ives and Eisman)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** AI investment remains strong, with capex expected to rise 20-30% in 2026 per industry reports. However, expert surveys (e.g., World Economic Forum) show 52% anticipate AI stock deflation due to overvaluation and hype. Media like NYT and VentureBeat warn of multiple AI "bubbles" bursting in 2026, with failures in AI startups by late year. MIT Sloan predicts AI bubble deflation impacting the economy.
     - **Evaluation:** Medium probability. While demand is real (e.g., early cycle supports growth), overhyping and potential pullbacks from energy constraints or diminishing returns make a full 20%+ rally uncertain amid volatility.

   - **Prediction: Apple to enter AI via Gemini partnership, leading to massive stock move.** (From Ives)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** Confirmed partnership announced January 12, 2026 (e.g., CNBC, Reuters), with Google’s Gemini powering Siri and future Apple AI features in a multiyear deal. This deepens Apple-Google ties, potentially boosting Apple’s AI capabilities amid competition.
     - **Evaluation:** High probability for the partnership (already happening), medium for "massive move" as stock reaction depends on integration success and market sentiment.

   - **Prediction: Palantir to $1T market cap; cybersecurity (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto) as AI derivatives; infrastructure like Nebius, GE Vernova bullish.** (From Ives)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** Palantir’s AI focus supports growth, but $1T would require massive scaling from current ~$100B+ cap. Cybersecurity demand is rising with AI threats. Nebius (former Yandex) is positioning as AI infrastructure provider, with stock up ~20% early 2026 and revenue projected to surge 521% to $3.45B (Seeking Alpha). GE Vernova benefits from energy needs.
     - **Evaluation:** Medium probability. Strong AI tailwinds, but $1T for Palantir is ambitious amid competition; infrastructure plays like Nebius have higher odds due to demand.

### 2. **Housing Market**
   - **Prediction: Housing is "still dead" due to regulations, not just rates; needs federal intervention for recovery; stocks need to turn up soon for 2026 chance.** (From Eisman)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** US housing shows signs of rebound: mortgage rates at ~6.06% (lowest in 3+ years, Freddie Mac), with sales up 3% projected (Redfin). Affordability improving as wages outpace prices (1% price growth expected). However, builder sentiment fell to 37 (NAHB), citing costs and regulations. Inventory growth (10-15%) could help, but experts like Realtor.com note persistent challenges.
     - **Evaluation:** Medium probability. Lower rates support turnaround, but regulatory hurdles (e.g., local zoning) contradict quick recovery without intervention.

### 3. **Tesla and Robotics**
   - **Prediction: Tesla to $600-800 stock price; robotaxis in 30 cities at level four; humanoid robotics real in 3-4 years.** (From Ives)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** Robotaxi deployment: Live in Austin (135 vehicles total, Texas DoT), expanding to Houston, Dallas, Phoenix (employee testing). But fleet is small (~35 in Austin, 130 in Bay Area), far from 30 cities or Musk's 1M goal. Stock forecasts vary; Motley Fool sees 2026 as "year of robotaxi" but regulatory approvals pending. Humanoids: Deployments starting (e.g., Boston Dynamics Atlas at Hyundai in 2026), with CES 2026 showcasing advances.
     - **Evaluation:** Low probability for 30 cities (current scale too small, regulations slow); medium for stock rally if deployments accelerate. Humanoids more likely in 3-4 years per trends.

### 4. **Software and Financials**
   - **Prediction: Software turnaround (Salesforce, Adobe, ServiceNow, Snowflake, MongoDB) with AI deployment; M&A overdue; regionals over money centers in leadership (e.g., Bank of America to $75).** (From Ives, Verrone)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** Software outlook positive: AI integration expected to drive recovery (Vanguard, CompTIA). M&A rising amid efficiency needs. Financials: Banks calm, supporting bull market; regionals (KRE ETF) poised over money centers per forecasts.
     - **Evaluation:** High probability. AI tailwinds and M&A trends support turnaround; financial leadership aligns with stable credit.

### 5. **Healthcare Sector**
   - **Prediction: Healthcare at 25-year low weight, poised for rebound; pharma/biotech lead; turnaround in 2026.** (From Verrone)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** Outlook positive: Deloitte survey shows 67% of leaders expect outperformance; EY notes growth amid headwinds. McKinsey projects EBITDA growth at 5% annually. Affordability issues persist (26% of execs cite as key trend).
     - **Evaluation:** High probability. Low valuations and innovation (e.g., GLP-1 drugs) support rebound.

### 6. **Fed Policy and Yields**
   - **Prediction: Fed cuts limited (e.g., 2-year yield stable at ~3.46%, neutral rate there).** (From Eisman, Verrone)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** 2-year yield at 3.56-3.59% (Treasury, FRED). Forecasts: J.P. Morgan expects no cuts in 2026, hold at 3.5-3.75%; others (Morningstar, CME) predict 1-2 cuts (50bp total). CBO sees cuts to 3.4% by 2028.
     - **Evaluation:** High probability. Sticky inflation and growth limit aggressive cuts.

### 7. **Commodities and Real Economy**
   - **Prediction: Commodities turn up as AI 2.0 signal; transports, regionals, housing, chemicals, commodities to lead "real economy" over speculative.** (From Verrone, Eisman)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** Mixed: BloombergNEF sees oil surplus, lower prices; World Bank predicts 7% drop in commodities. But AI/raw materials demand could boost (e.g., copper stable at $11,400/t, Goldman Sachs).
     - **Evaluation:** Medium probability. AI needs support upside, but surpluses contradict broad rally.

### 8. **Crypto Market**
   - **Prediction: Crypto in violent range for 12 months; Bitcoin rally to 105-110k but signals shift from speculative assets; weakness drives to real economy.** (From Eisman)
     - **Supporting/Contradicting Data:** Predictions: $75k-150k range (CNBC experts), with volatility expected (Kraken). Shift to "real" assets aligns with AI focus. No current price, but forecasts note macro/geopolitical risks.
     - **Evaluation:** High probability for volatility/range; medium for 105-110k rally amid uncertainties.

Overall, the episode's optimistic tone on AI/tech and sector turnarounds holds merit early in 2026, but execution risks (e.g., regulations, bubbles) temper probabilities. Markets remain volatile, with AI as a key driver.
