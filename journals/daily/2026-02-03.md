I'm going to sign up Aydin for a new gymnatic place starting next week.  Its 2hrs on Tuessday so we'll have to change our schedule but he'll be in a class with one of his friends froms  school.   

Alex called because she hasn't been able to get ahold of Bryan.  No one is answers the phone for the facility he's at.   We were able to message on instagram and do an interent call.  We still don't have a place for him.  The CFT is today at 2.  

I need to schedule a one-off with my Therapist.  Need ot wait until I start work so I can get in inline with my work schedule.

The offer on the house was submitted yesterday - they comfirmed receipt.  Now we just wait.  

The inspection and apprasial of our home istoday. I need to find a place to work all morning.   I'll try Panera but we'll see.

I orderd coupon cards for Aydin.  Nano-banana one-shotted the image generation with strong theme alignment and accurate text.  The future is now and so awesome.   I feel like I need to process the progress the last few years and grok what's going to over the next year.   I don't think I'm someone that really gets it yet.

I met with our ML director yesterday.   We had a good report - I was able to highlight some issues with the eval system he wasn't aware with that he said, "We need to fix this".   The base/golden set for evals are just from the PM team.  I dealt with eval loops with trained raters at instagram - I owned the data/analysis/reporting - and I saw that our PM team was far from correct.   The LLM has judge systems were very fragile.   Not sure waht to do with all this - still processing.

I had a very strong emotional reaction at work.  Another data scientist is leaving - and he seems very resentful that the company didn't work to keep him or match his counter offer.  I have to own his work and he's being obstitant in onboarding me.  He won't meet with me, he is very slow to respond, and it takes a lot of loops to just get a question answer because he'll point out other information that's not relevant.   I feel unsupported because he's treating negatively and being unhelpful because of how the company treated him.  I had nothing to do that and the lack fo care/empathy/support really triggers/frustrates me.  


Purple monkey butter!   There was a tiktok that had a purple song.  I used to just say 'purple' in a wierd way out of the blue as a teenager.  It was a thing I did.  It became a reference for decades with a few of my friends.   The tiktok is living rent free in my head - I want to get back to learning/practicing the piano once we're in a new house and I want to learn that song!  HAHAHAHHAhAHA!
