We recieved two offers yesterday.  Shorty after I started to cry when I had to urge to call and tell my parents.  My mom died in Aug of last year and my Dad passed in 2020.   This is the type of thing I would have told them about.

We later got additional offers and our agent said more are on the way.  We've sent counters to everyone to provide their best and final offers for us to consider at the end of the week.   

I had Claude download all of the shopify press releases.  The company changes the name format every so slightly that makes automation difficult.  They also have dead links for the press releases before 2018.   I'm not sure how thes analystics do it.  Now I'm having Calude try to extract data fromthe pdf.  

I started sharing the token issue at work.  My manager told me to work with a DE and this DE doesn't seeem to understand the problem.  She says things like, "Thank you for the input, I'll investigate more" and then in chats she'll say things that are incomplete.   She's decided on the problem before she's actually looked at everything.  This is a common pattern at shopify.  I need to figure out how to systematically deal with it.  I'm getting frustrated.
