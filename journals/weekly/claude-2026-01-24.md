# Weekly Review: January 16-24, 2026
Generated: 2026-01-24

## 🧠 What's Been On Your Mind

The house sale has dominated this week's mental space. You moved from fretting about patching and painting on the 16th to getting staged, photographed, and listed by the 23rd. The execution speed is impressive—you decided to sell just the Saturday before the 18th, and by the 24th you're seeing 1500+ views, 67 saves, and multiple showings. There's cautious optimism mixed with awareness that offers are "really out of my/our control." Visiting open houses crystallized what you want: something upgraded and ready, not a project, positioned as a "save point in life" that enables career autonomy.

Underneath the house logistics, Bryan Scott Smith's situation is creating persistent anxiety. His 18th birthday is February 10th and there's still no SMI facility secured. The CFT meeting on the 21st outlined a plan to find a BFI home in Phoenix within two weeks, but the same day he had a violent incident (hit another kid, potential police involvement) signaling stress from the transitions and his new girlfriend. You've got mounting todos: set up his checking account, connect with his school, get education on special needs trust accounting from Heather Welborn. The unfinished accounting and executor delays on Cecilia's trust (Brenda still hasn't contacted you after a month) compound a feeling of having to step in and take over responsibilities you'd rather not shoulder.

Shopify started with genuine excitement—AI-forward company, kind team, flexibility to stay in Irvine. But within days of your first analysis, you found 80%+ null values in the `message_tokens` table that had been broken for months without anyone noticing. This discovery on day one—finding both the problem and the fix by cross-referencing engineering monitoring tools—revealed poor data culture, weak DE/DS collaboration, and a team caliber below what you expected. You're now questioning the decision: "I may end up being a very big fish in a small pond. That can be good for promotions but not for how I want to work..." The affirmations about delivering impactful insights and being a problem solver feel like you're bracing to prove your value in an environment that might not demand it.

## 🎯 Focus Analysis

### Intended Focus (from goals)
- Wake up every morning, exercise ~1 hr, meditate 15 min, coffee after (stop by noon), 5g-15g creatine daily
- Progressive calisthenics skill improvement with daily practice
- Daily loving-kindness meditation, more physical touch with Behshad/Aydin, plan friend vacations, establish colleague routines
- Develop/maintain Shopify relationships, deliver clear high-impact work, structure days for positive high energy
- Document/package learning into sellable content

### Actual Focus (from journals)
- House preparation: patching, painting, staging coordination, open house visits, listing management, realtor friction
- Bryan guardianship crisis management: CFT meetings, incident response, trust accounting, todo list accumulation
- Shopify onboarding and first analysis work: data exploration, finding critical data quality issues
- Daily foundational habits: calisthenics (5/5 days), meditation (5/5 days), creatine (5/5 days)
- Family logistics: Aydin's homework/tablet concerns, Behshad's sleep/work stress
- Estate executor frustration: chasing Brenda on Cecilia's trust
- Daily affirmations practice (consistent across all entries)

### Alignment Assessment

The process adherence is stronger than the journal narrative suggests. You completed calisthenics workouts and 15-minute meditation sessions every single day (5/5 tracked days), and took 5g creatine daily. This is the foundation working despite chaos. However, sleep remains inconsistent (7h:07m → 5h:55m → unknown → 5h:07m → 7h:45m), you're not in ketosis despite attempting keto (likely the "keto bread" and chocolate chips), and the loving-kindness meditation specified in your goals isn't documented in the stats. The Shopify focus is happening but reactive (responding to data issues) rather than the proactive relationship-building you outlined. Side business has zero activity. You're executing core habits while urgent demands (house, Bryan) consume planning bandwidth.

## 📊 Scorecard

| Life Area | Goal Status | This Week | Trend | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Health & Energy | Wake/exercise/meditate/creatine daily | 6/10 | → | Creatine 5/5, meditation 15m daily 5/5, but sleep inconsistent (5-7hrs), not in ketosis, crashed car from fatigue |
| Fitness | Progressive calisthenics practice | 7/10 | ↑ | Calisthenics workouts completed 5/5 days during high-stress week, still recovering from meniscus |
| Connection | Daily loving-kindness, more touch, friend vacations | 4/10 | → | Standard meditation happening but no loving-kindness documented, some Aydin/Behshad moments (homework teaching), no friend/colleague routines started |
| Career (Shopify) | Relationships/impact/clarity/energy | 6/10 | ↑ | Completed onboarding, started first analysis, found critical data issue and fix, but growing doubts about team/culture fit |
| Side Business | Document/package learning | 1/10 | → | Zero activity, LLC still incurring costs with no progress |
| Family | Quality time with Behshad/Aydin | 5/10 | → | Present for Aydin's homework, aware of Behshad's struggles, but house stress consuming bandwidth |
| Investments | Portfolio review/research | 1/10 | → | No activity documented |

**Overall Week Score: 5/10**

### Scoring Rubric Note
This is a transition week under high external pressure. The score reflects maintained discipline on core habits (exercise, meditation, creatine) while navigating multiple crises, but with gaps in sleep quality, loving-kindness practice, and strategic career positioning.

## 😊 Mood & Energy Summary

Only one mood survey logged (Jan 24): Wired/Neutral. The "wired" state tracks with the data quality discovery at work and the high-stakes house listing. Sleep data shows high variability: 7+ hours on the 18th and 24th, but dropping to 5 hours on the 21st and 23rd. The car accident on the 23rd (crashed into workbench due to fatigue and seat position confusion) is a red flag for sleep debt accumulation. Behshad also isn't sleeping well. Energy is being spent faster than it's being replenished despite the exercise and meditation discipline. The consistent affirmations practice (every single journal entry) shows you're actively working on mindset maintenance.

## 💡 Recommendations

### Actions to Take

**Immediate (next 48 hours)**:
1. **Email Heather Welborn**: Request special needs trust accounting education and guardianship timeline given Bryan's Feb 10 birthday and pending BFI placement. Include the violent incident update and ask if it affects guardianship filing.
2. **Set up Bryan's checking account** with debit card for spending money (you can do this online in 20 minutes)
3. **Call Wells Fargo mortgage division** to inquire about rollover options—get this off your mental stack
4. **Email or call Brenda** (Cecilia's trust executor) with a clear deadline: "Need status update and action plan by [Jan 31] or will begin takeover process with attorney consultation"
5. **Call psychiatrist** for appointment and medication refill (you listed this on 1/21, don't let it slide)

**This Week**:
6. **Eliminate keto bread and chocolate chips** from diet—you identified these as likely ketosis blockers. Run a 3-day clean test and measure blood ketones.
7. **Document the Shopify data quality findings** in a concise write-up for your manager. Frame as "opportunities I'm seeing to raise the bar" with the fix you implemented. This establishes your value early.
8. **Schedule one 30-min coffee with a Shopify colleague** to start relationship-building routines (not optional if you want to influence upward)

### Focus Shifts

You're maintaining the daily disciplines (exercise, meditation, creatine) that create the foundation—this is the win of the week. The gap is in the specificity: your goals call for loving-kindness meditation specifically, not just general meditation. If the 15 minutes isn't including loving-kindness, add 5 minutes for it or shift the focus.

The Shopify concerns are real, but you're 2 weeks in. The data quality discovery is actually a strong opening move—you found something in days that went unnoticed for months and you fixed it. The question isn't whether to worry, it's how to leverage this. If you want Tobi's attention (you mentioned this on 1/23), you need to document and share wins like this strategically. But relationship-building has to start now, not after you've "proven yourself."

The side business deserves a binary decision: either shut down the LLC to stop the cost bleed, or commit 2 hours/week to packaging one piece of learning from your Shopify work. The current "ideating with costs" state is a tax on your mental stack.

### Rest & Recovery

You drove into your workbench because of seat position and fatigue. Sleep is too variable (5-7 hours) for sustained high performance. The 7h:45m on the 24th shows you can get there. After the open house weekend, take Sunday afternoon completely off—no house talk, no Bryan logistics, just family time or a nap. You can't sustain this pace through mid-February (Bryan's birthday, home closing if you get offers) without creating a bigger recovery deficit.

### Questions to Reflect On

1. **What would it look like to succeed at Shopify even if the team caliber is lower than you hoped?** Is "raising the bar" genuinely compelling, or do you need peer-level intellectual challenge to feel fulfilled? This question matters because it determines your energy and engagement trajectory.

2. **If Bryan's placement falls through or extends past Feb 10, what support do you need to avoid shouldering the entire burden alone?** Can Heather, the CFT, or others take specific tasks off your plate? What's the minimum viable involvement that meets your ethical obligations without breaking you?

3. **Your affirmations are consistent, but are they aligned with what you actually want?** The wealth affirmations are prominent ("centamillionaire," "enormous wealth"), but your journal entries suggest you care more about autonomy, impact, and connection. Are you affirming the right things?

## 📈 Patterns Across Reviews

This is the first Claude-generated weekly review, so no multi-week patterns to analyze yet. Future reviews will track:
- Guardian/trustee burden trends and capacity management
- Sleep quality correlation with diet/routine adherence
- Shopify satisfaction trajectory as onboarding progresses and data culture becomes clearer
- Connection practices (loving-kindness specifically, physical touch) vs. stated goals
- Side business: continued stagnation or decisive action

# Bryan's Notes
This is an impressive summary!

A few commentary notes on the summary:

- When I mediate it includes a loving/kindess mediation so I did accomplish that but that's not clear in the notes.  
- I'm not writing about the time I spend with my family.   I shoud include that or it looks like i"m not doing it.  When I write on the morning I'm focusing on what is stressors or open loops vs remembering/documenting what was good/nice/pleasant.
- I didn't write about my weekly conversations with Travis and Sean - two of my best friends.   Thess two relationships are very important to me.
- Most of Bryan's (my nephew) items are being handled by his care team.   We have decided to keep in in maricopa county and they're confident they will find placements.   The other items are non-urgent.
-  My psychatirst doesn't take my new insurance so I need to get a new one - that's still an open loop.
- Non Urgents:  Mortage, Taxes - these will be done in Feb I think
