# Weekly Review: January 18-31, 2026
Generated: 2026-01-31

## 🧠 What's Been On Your Mind

The house sale moved from listing to accepted offer to escrow in a compressed timeline that's both exciting and disorienting. You listed on January 22nd, had 50+ visitors at the open house, navigated multiple offers and counters as cash buyers backed out, and by January 30th signed an offer for $10k above listing. Escrow started with a February 20th target close. In parallel, you've been viewing homes—8 properties on the 25th alone—crystallizing preferences: you and Behshad both want something lower in the budget that you can customize as a "forever home" rather than stretching to buy someone else's vision. The math is clear: $1.3M sale minus $0.1M costs minus $0.4M mortgage leaves $0.8M, plus $1.6M portfolio gives $2.4M budget, though you don't want to liquidate everything.

Work concerns have shifted from "questioning the decision" to navigating cultural friction. You completed first drafts of your analysis and got positive peer feedback, but the pattern of premature conclusions continues—a DE "doesn't seem to understand the problem" and says "I'll investigate more" while making incomplete statements. You discovered the broken pipeline was recently created and backfilled, which your manager is justifying, but it "still speaks to a lack of quality/planning/diligence." Matteo (a peer DS) is leaving for Intuit due to pay. You're feeling pressure to move fast for perceived impact rather than be rigorous and correct, which conflicts with how you want to work. Your manager wants to control all leadership communication, which you recognize won't scale or improve data culture. Despite this, you're getting included in DS/PM meetings and getting traction on the token/cost analysis you stumbled into.

You made an explicit decision about the side business: putting it on hold. Between selling/buying a house and starting a new job, you "don't have the mental/stress budget to force this." Your P0 is maintaining energy, and forcing the business is "starting to lead to a burnout." You're not excited about it. You'll "hunt and peck" but it's now a stretch goal, not a core focus. This is a clear-eyed acknowledgment of capacity limits.

On January 31st, you snapped at Aydin about a blueberry on the floor during house-showing prep. You caught yourself, apologized, explained your concerns about cleanliness and trust-building without justifying the tone, and acknowledged that your reaction probably made him feel scared. You walked the long way to school doing "spins" to repair. You noted: "The affirmations help me call out the inconsistencies with my goals and my behaviors more easily." You're joining Aydin's playdate today specifically because you haven't had in-person friend time all month and "this fills my cup."

The trust and guardianship situations are escalating in different ways. Bryan was rejected from another facility on January 28th—a screening that felt predetermined, "a waste of time given his history." His February 10th birthday is 10 days away. For Cecilia's trust, you talked to Travis who advised writing a letter asking the executor to resign. Behshad researched that EINs should be filed within a week of death. You sent an email re-requesting the EIN mail date and acknowledgment of tax filing responsibility, and plan to call to build a document trail for potential legal action. On January 27th you called Brenda—she claims she's waiting on an EIN via SS-4 form but didn't respond when you asked for the mail date. You don't trust her.

Physically, you're showing wear. January 31st: "very sore last night," "cramps in the middle of the night," legs "not recovering well," "fatigue build up in my shoulders and back from the calisthenics workouts." Sleep was 6h13m and 5h46m the past two days. You're maintaining the daily calisthenics workouts but starting to consider whether you need to deload or update training plans.

## 🎯 Focus Analysis

### Intended Focus (from goals)
- Wake up every morning, exercise ~1 hr, meditate 15 min, coffee after (stop by noon), 5g-15g creatine daily
- Progressive calisthenics skill improvement with daily practice
- Daily loving-kindness meditation, more physical touch with Behshad/Aydin, plan friend vacations, establish colleague routines
- Develop/maintain Shopify relationships, deliver clear high-impact work, structure days for positive high energy
- Document/package learning into sellable content

### Actual Focus (from journals)
- House sale execution: managing offers, counters, viewing 8+ properties, signing offer, starting escrow
- Shopify analysis work: completing first drafts, getting peer feedback, navigating DE collaboration friction, attending DS/PM meetings
- Trust/guardianship crisis management: researching timelines, calling/emailing executor, building document trail, facility rejection for Bryan
- Research projects: Started TSMC and Shopify deep-dive research to understand businesses and build dashboards
- Daily foundational habits: Calisthenics (maintained daily), meditation with loving-kindness (10m/5m consistently), creatine (5g daily), cycling (varied)
- Family repair and connection: Aydin apology/repair conversation, planning playdate attendance for friend time, Dave & Busters outing
- Explicit decision to pause side business due to capacity constraints

### Alignment Assessment

The process habits remain remarkably consistent: daily calisthenics, 10m meditation + 5m loving-kindness, 5g creatine. This is the foundation holding during high turbulence. Sleep is deteriorating (5h46m to 6h13m this week) and physical recovery is suffering—you're noting soreness, cramps, and fatigue accumulation. The Aydin incident and your reflection show the affirmations are working as designed: you're catching misalignment between stated values (kind, loving, attentive father) and actual behavior, then repairing it.

The side business decision is mature capacity management—you named the reality that forcing it leads to burnout and you're not excited about it. This opens bandwidth rather than creates guilt. Career focus is happening but defensive (navigating friction) rather than proactive (relationship building, strategic positioning). The research projects (TSMC, Shopify) show you're following curiosity and building long-term knowledge assets, but they're "understand slow" work that conflicts with the "move fast" pressure at Shopify.

Connection is mixed: you identified the gap (no in-person friend time all month) and are taking action (joining playdate). Daily family time is happening but not journaled (per your previous feedback). Colleague relationship routines still haven't started.

## 📊 Scorecard

| Life Area | Goal Status | This Week | Trend | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| Health & Energy | Wake/exercise/meditate/creatine daily | 5/10 | ↓ | Sleep 5h46m-6h13m, soreness/cramps/fatigue building, maintained creatine/meditation but recovery suffering |
| Fitness | Progressive calisthenics practice | 6/10 | → | Daily workouts maintained but fatigue accumulating in shoulders/back, legs not recovering well, may need deload |
| Connection | Daily loving-kindness, more touch, friend vacations | 5/10 | ↑ | Loving-kindness 5m daily, identified friend time gap and taking action (playdate), repaired Aydin incident, no colleague routines yet |
| Career (Shopify) | Relationships/impact/clarity/energy | 5/10 | → | Completed analysis drafts with positive feedback, included in DS/PM meetings, but cultural friction deepening, manager gatekeeping leadership access |
| Side Business | Document/package learning | 0/10 | → | Explicitly paused—mature decision given capacity, but LLC costs continuing with no activity |
| Family | Quality time with Behshad/Aydin | 6/10 | ↑ | Dave & Busters trip, Aydin repair conversation, home search collaboration with Behshad, joining playdate for connection |
| Investments | Portfolio review/research | 3/10 | ↑ | Started TSMC/Shopify research projects for long-term knowledge building, but no portfolio management activity |

**Overall Week Score: 5/10**

### Scoring Rubric Note
This score reflects maintained discipline on daily habits while navigating high external demands (house sale, work ramp, trust issues), but with concerning deterioration in sleep/recovery and continued gaps in strategic career positioning. The side business pause and friend connection action are bright spots showing self-awareness.

## 😊 Mood & Energy Summary

Mood surveys show a consistent pattern: predominantly **Tired** (4 out of 8 logged days), with **Neutral** mood dominating (7 out of 8 days). The outliers: one "Wired" day (Jan 24, from previous week), one "Comfortable" feeling (Jan 26, 28, 29), and one "Happy" day (Jan 31, despite being tired). The January 27th entry noted "neutral (slightly sad)" when you cried about wanting to tell your parents about the house offers—a moment of grief breaking through the busy-ness.

The "tired" trend is backed by physical data: sleep at 5h46m and 6h13m, soreness, night cramps, and explicit fatigue accumulation. You're spending energy faster than you're replenishing it. The January 31st "Happy" rating despite being tired suggests the Aydin repair conversation and upcoming playdate connection are meaningful to you.

## 💡 Recommendations

### Actions to Take

**Immediate (next 48 hours)**:
1. **Close the LLC or commit 2 hours/week**—you made the decision to pause, now execute it. Either file dissolution paperwork to stop the cost bleed, or schedule one 2-hour block weekly to work on it. The current state is a tax on your mental stack.

2. **Schedule deload week or modify training**—you noted "fatigue build up" and "not recovering well" with explicit consideration of updating training plans. Trust that signal. Either plan a deload week or reduce volume/intensity for 5-7 days to allow recovery.

3. **Send the letter to Cecilia's trust executor**—Travis advised it, Behshad researched the timelines, you've built the document trail. Draft the letter requesting resignation and securing correspondence/bills. Set a response deadline (7 days). This moves from passive documentation to active intervention.

**This Week**:
4. **Schedule one 30-minute coffee with a Shopify colleague**—not your manager, not the DE you're frustrated with. Someone lateral or senior who's been there longer. You need information channels outside your manager's gatekeeping if you want to understand the culture and build influence. This is overdue from last week's recommendations.

5. **Block 2 hours to model home purchase scenarios**—you noted "I should model this out and look for alternatives—there might be options" regarding the $2.4M budget math. You're about to make one of the biggest financial decisions of your life. Model it: what if you keep more stocks invested? What mortgage rates are available? What's the true cost of different price points? Get clarity before you're in a time crunch.

6. **Write the dentist/psychiatrist/physical on your calendar with deadlines**—these are on your list for the third week. Pick dates in February and schedule them or explicitly decide they're not priorities right now. Carrying them as vague todos is mental overhead.

### Focus Shifts

You're executing daily disciplines (calisthenics, meditation, creatine) at the expense of recovery. The goal isn't just to do the habits, it's to build health and energy. Sleep at 5-6 hours with accumulating fatigue and night cramps is a signal to adjust intensity, not push through. Consider: what would happen if you did 30 minutes of gentle movement instead of a full calisthenics workout for 3 days? Would that serve the goal (health and energy) better than maintaining the process (daily workout)?

The research projects (TSMC, Shopify) are intellectually compelling and align with how you want to work ("understand slow"), but they're in direct tension with the Shopify culture you're describing ("move fast for perceived impact"). This isn't necessarily wrong—deep understanding can generate differentiated insights—but it's a bet that quality will win over speed. Be explicit with yourself about whether you believe that bet pays off at Shopify, or if you're building knowledge assets for a future role.

You identified the friend connection gap ("I know this fills my cup") and took action (joining playdate). Do the same for colleague relationships. You can't build influence at Shopify or understand the culture through your manager alone. One coffee per week with someone new for the next 4 weeks will give you the information you need to decide if this is the right place.

### Rest & Recovery

The physical signals are clear: soreness, cramps, fatigue accumulation, 5-6 hours of sleep. You're approaching the February 10th deadline for Bryan, the February 20th home close, and you're three weeks into a new job while managing trust/executor issues. This is not sustainable without rest.

**Prescription**: After the playdate today (Saturday), take Sunday completely off. No house search, no research projects, no journal review, no affirmations work. Sleep as late as you can, take a nap, go for an easy walk. Monday morning, reassess your training intensity for next week—consider a deload or modified program that prioritizes recovery over volume.

Sleep is the foundation. If you're getting 5-6 hours and noting cramps and fatigue, something has to give. Is it the early wake-up time? The training intensity? Evening screen time? Stress about the house/work/trust? Identify the blocker and address it, because everything else (career performance, family presence, problem-solving) degrades without sleep.

### Questions to Reflect On

1. **What does "winning" at Shopify look like to you now that you understand the culture better?** You wanted Tobi's attention, to raise the bar, to improve data culture. After three weeks, is that still compelling? Or does the "move fast" culture and manager gatekeeping make those goals feel less achievable or less interesting? Clarity here determines your strategy.

2. **You caught yourself snapping at Aydin and repaired it because the affirmations helped you notice the gap. What other gaps are the affirmations revealing?** You're affirming "enormous wealth" but pausing the business. You're affirming "clear and impactful insights" but frustrated by cultural friction. Are the affirmations aligned with what you actually want, or are they aspirational in a way that creates tension?

3. **If the Cecilia's trust executor continues to stall and you have to take over, what boundaries do you need to set to protect your capacity?** This isn't a question of if but when. What does "good enough" execution look like that doesn't consume you?

## 📈 Patterns Across Reviews

**Week 1 (Jan 16-24) → Week 2 (Jan 18-31) Trends:**

**Sleep degradation**: Week 1 varied 5-8 hours with a car accident from fatigue. Week 2 is consistently 5-6 hours with physical consequences (cramps, soreness). This is a deteriorating trend that needs intervention.

**Shopify concerns deepening**: Week 1 was "questioning the decision" after finding the token tracking issue. Week 2 is "pressure to move fast vs be rigorous," DE collaboration friction, manager gatekeeping, and peer departure. The initial concern is being validated by additional data points. The question is shifting from "is this real?" to "what am I going to do about it?"

**Side business clarity**: Week 1 was "ideating with costs" and LLC tax burden. Week 2 is an explicit decision to pause due to capacity constraints and lack of excitement. This is progress—you eliminated ambiguity and freed up mental space.

**Family connection awareness**: Week 1 didn't document positive family time (per your feedback). Week 2 shows growing awareness of connection gaps (no friend time all month) and active intervention (joining playdate, Aydin repair, Dave & Busters trip). The affirmations are working—you're noticing misalignment and acting on it.

**Trust/guardianship escalation**: Week 1 was "chasing Brenda" passively. Week 2 is building a document trail, talking to Travis about resignation letters, researching timelines, preparing for legal action. This is moving from reactive to proactive.

**Daily discipline consistency**: Two weeks of maintained calisthenics, meditation with loving-kindness, and creatine despite house sale, work ramp, and crisis management. This is the foundation that's allowing you to function under pressure. The question is whether you're maintaining it at the cost of recovery.

**Research curiosity emerging**: Week 2 introduced TSMC and Shopify research projects. This is your natural mode ("understand slow") asserting itself despite the Shopify culture pressure. It's either a valuable differentiation strategy or a coping mechanism to do work that feels meaningful while the job disappoints. Time will tell.

# Notes from Brybry!

- I'm going to do some revs on my affirmations today.  This is a good callout.  I found myself feeling disconnected from some of these as I was doing them this week.  

- I'm not going to close the LLC.  The only cost is the $800/year tax bill that I'm fine with spending.  There isn't a bleed here.  Plus that next bill isn't until next year.   I already have to pay that since the LLC exists.  I gain nothing by closing before the end of the year.   I can re-evaluate in Nov.
