Run a weekly journal review following the process in `journals/CLAUDE.md`.

1. Read ALL context files:
   - `context/goals/2026.md`
   - `context/goals/life.md`
   - `context/state/life-areas.yaml`
   - `context/state/open-loops.md`
   - `context/history/decisions.md`

2. Read all daily journals from the past 14 days in `journals/daily/`

3. Read all previous weekly reviews in `journals/weekly/claude-*.md`

4. Generate the review following the exact format specified in `journals/CLAUDE.md`

5. Save the output to `journals/weekly/claude-{{DATE}}.md` where {{DATE}} is today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format

Be direct, specific, and reference actual journal content. Don't be artificially positive - honest assessment helps more than cheerleading.
